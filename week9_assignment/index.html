This big stinky green hero has more charm than his appearance would have you guess, and flaunts it (unknowingly) all the time. He's honestly kind of in king mode, bestowing swag and slay upon the realms.` },

			last:"But specifically from the third movie where she essentially threatens to kill Draco Malfoy on the schools campus",
			credit: `Hermoine: *jamming her wand up against Malfoy's adams apple which is weird cause its basically a lethal weapon and we're on a school set* "I swear to god Draco, make one more aggressive questionably romantic gesture towards Harry and we're gonna start thinking its not an act."

			last:"From the hit youtube series Spongebob but Anime",
			credit:`In a world where Japan took over the united states we'd have gotten anime spongebob. A version packed with moral lessons, character trope implications, and epic action sequences. But it'd also have horribly paid animators. So you know.. pros and cons.`},
			
			{first:"Buzz",
			last:"Lightyear",
			credit:` From hit Disney movie "Toy Story", and its sequels, this space-faring nomad solves punches first and asks questions while punching. Also was used for one of the most insane meme edits of the 20th century and shows how broken our new sense of humor is becoming. Don't believe me? Go on youtube and type in 'Buzz Lightyear we're not aiming for the truck meme edit'. Go on.. I'll give you a minute. Oh back already? YEAH MESSED UP RIGHT?` },
