    <h1> Michael Anthony Francis Villanueva </h1>

<p style="border:5px solid honeydew"> Hi, this is my (second) first web page for KT's HTML+Javascript class! 
    My name, as stated above is Michael. I prefer to go by Mike from people
    I don't know well or Mikey by my friends. I play Soccer and Volleyball to stay active
    and have been getting back into rock climbing and running when I have the free time. 
    My passions are making music, drawing character art, writing stories, and playing video games. 
    I really struggled my first time through this class but I was a lot less mature and ready to learn.
    I think a big part of that stemmed from being in a major that I didn't want to be in. Since determining 
    that it wasn't what I wanted to do and that it was just draining my mental energy. I quietly quit on the major. 
    I took that opprotunity to sit and talk with my parents and tell them that I needed to be in school for something 
    that properly engaged me. My mom was onboard but my father was skeptical. So now I'm striving to prove myself right 
    and him wrong. This is something I can do and I can be happy doing it!
