<!-- Client sided scripting language -->
    <!-- Client-side: script runs on your computer and not a server -->
    <!-- Scripting: language is not compiled, read and interpreted at run-time -->

<!-- Dynamic -->
    <!-- Changes page content without reloading -->

<!-- load order: Top to Bottom // Similar to Python and HTML --> 

<!-- <script src="scripts/script.js"></script> javascript tag, almost exclusively found in body element-->

<!-- For instance if you place it in the head it won't read anything outside of the head tag before executing. so you're body work won't get the javascript additions -->

<!-- a name followed immediately by a paranthesis () is almost certainly a function -->
<!-- {} are used instead of : to determine if we're in a code block, much like C++ -->
<!-- literal string uses ` marks. This mark can be found beneath the escape key and is on the same key as the tilde ~ . -->
<!-- Javascript uses camelcase for function names. (i.e) myFunction or thisIsMyFunction -->
<!-- Naming conventions: Start with lowercase letter / can contain digits 0-9 / Can contain upper and lower case / only special character allowed is an underscore _ -->

<!-- JS DATA TYPES
Contain values
    String
        = A group of characters surrounded by "" or ``
        ex: var className ="HTML & Javascript class"     
    
    Number
        = Any numbers, including decimals and negatives
        ex: var num = 3.14

    Boolean 
        = The value of true or false
        ex: var result = true  (will equal true until told otherwise or changed)
    
    Function
        = A group of stored processes
        ex: function hello() {console.log("hello world")}

    Object
        = A way to separate and store data into organized sections
        ex: (wont cover till week 10)
-->

<!-- Cannot contain values
    Null = Means the variable or function does not exist

    Undefined = the variable is declared but has no value
 -->

 <!-- To declare a variable in Javascript, we use the keyword -> var -->
 <!-- To assign value, we use the = operator -->

 <!-- Conditional Statements

    Condition
        Value | Comparative | Value
    conditional statements in Javascript you must use ()
    All conditions in JS are grouped within parenthesis
  -->

  <!-- 
    == checks equality of values
    === Checks equality of values and data types
    != Values not equal to
    !== Values and data types are not equal
    > Greater than
    < Less than
    >= Greater than or equal to
    <= Less than or equal to
    && and
    || or

    Very similar to C++ you can use a lot of the tools and tips Marty has given you to simplify and actuate your code

<!-- COMMON JS FUNCTIONS 

    console.log()
        Used for debugging 
        writes info directly to console

    alert()
        Used for debugging and messages
        Creates a pop-up
        Stops program run until OK is clicked

    prompt()
        Can be used to collect data from a user. 
        The prompt() function has two parameters = A message and a default value
