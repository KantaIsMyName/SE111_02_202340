            <p> Welcome to the Review page of the site. While many of the writings on this site may feel like review this will be the only page with in depth descriptions and deep diving on material. This is in order to avoid spoilers for those who've yet to see the film, those who've only read the book, or those who've never heard of it before. That being said this page is bound to rife with spoilers so if you've yet to watch all the way through, or even read the book, this is your sign to turn around and go watch the film first.

            <p> The Fundamentals of Caring follows the character Ben Benjamin as he struggles to find true meaning in his life. His wife is trying to force through a divorce, that Ben seemingly doesn't want. He is an out of work writer citing writers block and an inability to be creative. As such he takes a six week caregivers course and tries to shake up the mundanity of life. Oddly enough someone else is trying to do something similar, introducing Trevor! Trevor suffers from Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy. A rare disease that slowly takes away your ability to move and operate your body autonimously. Eventually, it results in death. Trevor knows this and as such becomes sarcastic and thrives off dark or 'innapropriate' humor. This causes the two to become fast friends as Ben meets people where they're at instead of expecting them to meet him where he is. This nets Ben a job and the two soon depart on a nation wide roadtrip to see all the American Road side attractions, a personal facination of Trevors. On this trip they will meet friends, share life experiences, and shatter traumas. How they manage to do so is all within the details of the constantly evolving trip. At times it really does feel like more than just the Fundamentals. </p>

                <p> My Review on <em> The Fundamentals of Caring</em></p>

                <p> The Fundamentals of Caring is a strong example of what makes a live action movie feel like a story more than a spectacle. In a sea of superhero movies, spy flicks, and action heavy cinematography The Fundamentals of Caring stands tall as having NONE of those elements. Far too often we're fed spectacle over story and it's truly started sapping the life out of the movie industry. This is a story about a man down on his luck, his attempts to give himself some form of closure, and the journey to do so. But it's so much more than that it's also a story about bravery, fighting against fate, taking action in spite of fear, and pursuing life goals. For a film littered with childish jokes such as "a little bite of the james" alluding a dick joke while offering up a slim jim to Trevor after a gas stop. This is where the casting choices really shine through. Paul Rudd has an immaculate stage presence, even on screen, and combos with Craig Roberts spectacularly. The duo have an almost instinctual comedic timing and essence between them, which is only amplified by the additions of Selena Gomez and Meghan Ferguson. 

                    Once Selena and Meghan enter the scene the dynamic changes vastly. We quickly shift to a more parental view of Ben and a more stereotypical view of Trevor as a teenager. This is exemplified in Trevor and Dots date at a diner across the street from one of the many motel hotels they stop at. The date goes well and Ben spends the night alone with Peaches. The two discuss what they're thinking of the date and the concerns if it goes poorly. But Peaches undying positivity makes it hard to imagine that scenario. And ultimately it does go well, the two have a successful date, saving the group from a very awkward car ride. It's interesting watching the romantic dynamic when we ultimately understand they won't be living near eachother after this trip. It's almost like they put it in just so that Trevor could prove that it was possible. That his chair didn't lock him out of standing amongst the rest when it comes to dating. Ultimately this experience grants Trevor new found confidence in himself. Which we see come to its summation at the end of the film when he finally pees into the biggest pit in the world. Its at that very same pit that we see Ben overcome his trauma in two ways. He confronts the person who has been tailing them since picking up Dot, and he helps Peaches give birth to her child. The first is solving Bens trauma of feeling like he has no given direction, choice, or mandate over his life. Confrontation and understanding that he had been caring for Dot as well as Trevor all this time forces him to confront the fact that he's been making his own choices and following his own direction all this time. Secondly by helping Peaches give birth to her child safely even at the bottom of this massive pit, Ben feels closure for the death of his own child which was killed by his own mistake. Long ago Ben accidentally left the car in neutral with the parking brake off, the car rolled down the drive an inevitably hit his child, taking their life in the process. We assume this is why Ben is avoiding the divorce and why his wife wants one. At the very end he also gets divorced and resumes writing. This time, about his journey with Trevor. With whom he is still in contact with.

                    <h3><em> The Fundamentals of Caring </em> <B>Trivia!</B> </h3>

                    <ul>
                        <li> Trivia #1: The vehicle that Ben is provided to transpot Trevor in is a Mobility Ventures MV-1. It is the first and only vehicle designed from the ground up for wheelchair accessibility. It meets or exceeds all ADA guidelnies for vehicles straight off the assembly line.
                        </li><br>
                        <li> Trivia #2: The sign in front of the church that Ben enters to attend his caregiver class carries the name "Abundent Life Church", a likely nod towards one of the main themes of the film. 

                        </li><br>
                        <li> Trivia #3: When Ben is talking to Dot's father, he mentions that Trevor's illness affects 1 in every 3,500 males. This is a direct correlation to when Trevor asks people to pick a number between 1 and 3,500; he's essentially quoting the statistics of his illness.

                        </li><br>
                        <li> Trivia #4: (around 51 minutes into the film) The group is driving through a tunnel. This was actually filmed on the Trans Canada (#1) Highway in Alberta, Canada and is actually a wildlife overpass in Banff National Park. This tunnel is located before the Castle Junction exit.

                        </li> <br>
                        <li> Trivia #5: The entirety of this films recording process happened in the span of 26 days.
