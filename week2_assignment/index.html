                My name, as stated above is Michael. I prefer to go by Mike from people
                I don't know well or Mikey by my friends. I play Soccer and Volleyball to stay active
                and have been getting back into rock climbing and running when I have the free time. 
                My passions are making music, drawing character art, writing stories, and playing video games. 
                Though coding is quickly finding its way into that list as well, when I actually sit down and do it. 
                <br>
                I have two dogs: Peanut and Bonnie, both rescues. I've got a major in theater from SHU with 
                specializations in: Directing, Singing, Voice Acting, and Improv. I've done over 36 productions, over 40 improv shows and 4 student films.

                I've been playing Futbol, or soccer, for 16 years and Volleyball for 2 years. I've been working towards becoming an independant music producer and artist on the side since 2020. I've been dabbling in photography since I was a kid, I used to ask my mom for cameras for christmas. I still have my old water proof cameras I'd take snorkeling and my old digital nikon that I filled with vacation photos. Ironically I hate getting my picture taken!
